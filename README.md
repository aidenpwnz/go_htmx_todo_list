# go_htmx_todo_list
A todo list app made with Go, HTMX, Templ and tailwindcss. Echo was used as a web framwork.

A good exercise to learn Go from scratch as a first timer, while also peeking into HTMX.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/aidenpwnz/go_htmx_todo_list.git

2. Install dependencies:
make init

3. Run the application:
make run
This command will start the Go server, compile the Tailwind CSS styles, and watch for changes in the project files.

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:7173` (proxied by templ) to access the Todo List app.
